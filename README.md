todolist
========

todolist on my personal page.

welcome to give any advice to help me add more meaningful TODOs onto my todolist

## HOW TO ADVISE?

please use github's issue function to give me advice on todolist, just [make a new issue](https://github.com/fifth/todolist/issues/new)

if interesting i will add it onto my todolist and mark the contributer as your name with a promote link

maybe you can write the wiki pages directly but remember to follow [the model page](https://github.com/fifth/todolist/wiki/wiki%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2)

you may open the page above and click "edit" and then copy the whole md file. then click "new page" and paste the content you copied just now into it and delete the things you don't want and write the things you want in it. After all complete, click "save"
